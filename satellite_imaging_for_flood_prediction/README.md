# 🌊 Satellite Image-Based Flood Prediction

This project focuses on environmental monitoring using satellite data to predict the occurrence of floods. It uses both CNN and RNN-based models on structured data for accurate flood classification.

## 📁 Files Included
- `kaggle.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all code (preprocessing, training, evaluation)
- `train.csv`: Training dataset
- `test.csv`: Testing dataset

## 🧠 Models Used
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Segmentation & Feature Extraction
3. Model Training (CNN and RNN)
4. Prediction (Flood / No Flood)

## 💡 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn

## 📝 How to Run
1. Clone this repo or download ZIP
2. Open `kaggle.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab
3. Run all cells

## 📌 Project Goal
To develop a flood prediction system using satellite or environmental data, helping with early disaster warning.
