#  Flood Prediction with Satellite Imagery

This project leverages satellite data to monitor environmental conditions and predict flood events. By combining **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, the system aims to classify flood occurrences with high accuracy.
